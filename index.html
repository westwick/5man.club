      <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
      <p>
        We are a group of players that are tired of playing with random people
        that don't have any teamwork, don't communicate, and don't care about
        team comp.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we've created a <strong>framework</strong> for how we want to
        approach the game as well as how we approach each round. This is
        important to differentiate from "strats".
      </p>
      <p>
        This framework seeks to minimize common annoyances and pet peeves in
        Valorant such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uncoordinated buy rounds (3 people save, 2 people buy)</li>
        <li>
          Competing calls for strats (lack of leader, 2 people trying to both
          call strats)
        </li>
        <li>AFKs (obviously)</li>
        <li>
          All 5 teammates rushing the same way on offense (making it really
          obvious for the other team to rotate and flank)
        </li>
        <li>
          Unclear communications (someone calls "THEYRE ALL COMING A" when its
          only 3 people)
        </li>
        <li>
          Over communication (talking about non-game stuff, back-seating, etc)
        </li>
        <li>
          Rotating too late or too early, leaving a site wide open before
          they've committed
        </li>
        <li>Team doesn't retake together (goes in 1 by 1...)</li>
        <li>
          Pushing too much on defense, playing too passively on offense, peeking
          when you don't need to
        </li>
        <li>Uncoordinated utility usage</li>
        <li>4+ duelist comps</li>
        <li>
          "Are we going A or B???" - you don't always need to decide at round
          start, let the round play out a bit first. And don't neglect the
          middle!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are creating a system that seeks to minimize or eliminate these
        annoyances as much as possible. However, we are not trying to "go pro"
        or play in tournaments. We just want to 5 stack ranked games with the
        best chances of winning, utilizing team play as much as possible. So
        read on if you're interested to learn more and see if this system is a
        good fit for you.
      </p>
      <h2>Who is this NOT for?</h2>
      <p>
        If you saw this page and your first thought was, "oh man that's too much
        to read", this team might not be for you. If you just want to jump in
        games and play, this team isn't for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to be focused on playing and winning as a team and being as
        organized as possible both in and out of game.
      </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Ok so who am I and why should you listen to me? I'm not a super great
        player, I can usually get to plat when I play enough, but my personal
        thinking is that your strats don't need to be 100% optimized and the
        "absolute best", what is more important is that everyone is on the same
        page in terms of what they are expected to do each round and what they
        expect their teammates to do. In other words, a poor plan is better than
        no plan at all. But I don't think my plan is poor anyway :D and I also
        think it's important to have one main person driving the framework so we
        can all work from a unified vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides Valorant, I played a lot of CS back in the day starting around
        2000, and played competitively for a bit as well, before e-sports was
        really a thing. So this framework is something I've put together based
        on all that experience as well as stuff I've just been thinking about
        over the years. Again, my framework may not be something that C9 or TSM
        or 100T or whoever can take and win a tournament with, but I hope it's
        good enough to keep most players diamond and below coordinated.
      </p>
      <h2>Organization</h2>
      <p>
        Besides the actual framework for how we approach each round, I think
        it's also important to have everyone on the same page with regards to
        how we discuss strategy, how and when we play, and basically everything
        outside of the actual game itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we grow and get more members, I'd like to split the team up by
        geography and rank, but for now at the beginning, we are focusing on
        Bronze/Silver/Gold players in US Central and US East. More on this in
        the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discord is our main place to organize and discuss any changes to the
        framework, which will be outlined on this site and open for anyone to
        make suggestions and changes to. The idea is that in your
        free-time/off-time/whenever we don't have 5 on, you can review the
        framework online and discuss it with others on discord to become very
        familiar with it. That way, when we DO have 5 people online, we can
        maximize our playing time and go immediately into games, since we should
        already be familiar with the concepts, and not have to waste time
        reviewing "strats" with someone new or something like that.
      </p>
      <h2>The Framework</h2>
      <p>
        Ok enough chat, I'm sure you're wondering what the actual framework is
        at this point. So let's get into it...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >The basis of the framework is to split the team up into groups of 2,
          2 and 1.</strong
        >
        Similar to basketball where you have 2 guards, 2 forwards, and a center.
        This works on both offense and defense and brings several advantages
        besides just in game tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
        First let's talk about why organizing the team this way is good from an
        outside of the game perspective. None of us are pros and we all play for
        fun, and everyone will have different schedules, and everyone will go
        through phases where they play a lot and then don't play much at all for
        a while. We want to ideally have groups of 7-10 people that we can draw
        from, and it really sucks practicing strats with 4 people and then
        having a 5th that's clueless. So by breaking the team up into roles, we
        create a "plug-n-play" system that's easy to rotate players in and out
        of, and have them instantly know how to work with the team because of
        the role and the framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another advantage is familiarity. By splitting into two groups of 2, you
        have a 'partner' you can work with essentially, and when we don't have 5
        on, you can just duo queue with your partner and still practice working
        together, become familiar with each other and know how they like to
        play, etc. and that will directly translate to our own 5 man games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, as the in game leader, it's easier to reason about 2 groups of 2
        rather than 4 individual players. In this system, the 1 person by
        themself is referred to as the 'lone wolf' and is always the one calling
        the plays and making the calls mid round, whether they are dead or
        alive. The other 2 groups of 2 can be assigned any animal name they
        choose, to make it very easy for the lone wolf to call out strats. As a
        very simple example, the lonewolf might call out "me and the tigers are
        going to work mid, bears lurk outside of A and then we will execute
        together when I say go". Although you still can call more complicated
        strats, this gives us a nice baseline to work with.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also gives us a lot of flexibility with how to organize the team
        each round, i.e. you can have the 2 groups of 2 group up while the lone
        wolf lurks, to create a 4-1 type of split. Or the lone wolf can group
        with either team to create a 3/2, or go completely alone from them in a
        2-2-1 type of deal. There's lots of options and everyone should be able
        to easily reason about what their teammates are trying to do. It's also
        important to note that the groups of 2 don't always have to stick
        together. They might need to split up for map control, or maybe they are
        the ones watching the 2 flanks while the other 3 work mid, etc.
      </p>
      <h2>The Specifics</h2>
      <p>
        So that's the high level overview of how we organize the team in game,
        but there is a lot more to the framework than just that. This section is
        a work in progress while I just jot out random thoughts right now. For
        example, how does it address some of those pet peeves from above?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Uncoordinated buy rounds -
          <span
            >Lone Wolf will always call whether to buy or save, usually based on
            if at least 3 people can buy rifles.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Competing calls for strats -
          <span
            >Lone Wolf always makes the main calls and has the final say</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          AFKs - <span>This shouldn't be an issue on our team, right?</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Over communication (talking about non-game stuff, back-seating, etc) -
          <span>Just don't do it on this team :)</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          4+ duelist comps - Each group of 2 can not have more than 1 duelist.
          That means, AT MAXIMUM our team will have 3 duelists, and only if the
          lone wolf chooses a duelist. More often we will probably prefer 2
          duelist comps, with a duelist in each group of 2.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>TBD:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Rotating too late or too early, leaving a site wide open before
          they've committed -
          <span
            >again this will be in our individual round section on how we handle
            this</span
          >

        <li>

          >

          All 5 teammates rushing the same way on offense -
          <span>This will be detailed in the individual round section</span>

            >We will have guidelines for how we make calls out, detailed in the
            individual round section</span
          >
