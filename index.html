      <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
      <p>
        We are a group of players that are tired of playing with random people
        that don't have any teamwork, don't communicate, and don't care about
        team comp.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we've created a <strong>framework</strong> for how we want to
        approach the game as well as how we approach each round. This is
        important to differentiate from "strats".
      </p>
      <p>
        This framework seeks to minimize common annoyances and pet peeves in
        Valorant such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uncoordinated buy rounds (3 people save, 2 people buy)</li>
        <li>
          Competing calls for strats (lack of leader, 2 people trying to both
          call strats)
        </li>
        <li>AFKs (obviously)</li>
        <li>
          All 5 teammates rushing the same way on offense (making it really
          obvious for the other team to rotate and flank)
        </li>
        <li>
          Unclear communications (someone calls "THEYRE ALL COMING A" when its
          only 3 people)
        </li>
        <li>
          Over communication (talking about non-game stuff, back-seating, etc)
        </li>
        <li>
          Rotating too late or too early, leaving a site wide open before
          they've committed
        </li>
        <li>Team doesn't retake together (goes in 1 by 1...)</li>
        <li>
          Pushing too much on defense, playing too passively on offense, peeking
          when you don't need to
        </li>
        <li>Uncoordinated utility usage</li>
        <li>4+ duelist comps</li>
        <li>
          "Are we going A or B???" - you don't always need to decide at round
          start, let the round play out a bit first. And don't neglect the
          middle!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are creating a system that seeks to minimize or eliminate these
        annoyances as much as possible. However, we are not trying to "go pro"
        or play in tournaments. We just want to 5 stack ranked games with the
        best chances of winning, utilizing team play as much as possible. So
        read on if you're interested to learn more and see if this system is a
        good fit for you.
      </p>
      <h2>Who is this NOT for?</h2>
      <p>
        If you saw this page and your first thought was, "oh man that's too much
        to read", this team might not be for you. If you just want to jump in
        games and play, this team isn't for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to be focused on playing and winning as a team and being as
        organized as possible both in and out of game.
      </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Ok so who am I and why should you listen to me? I'm not a super great
        player, I can usually get to plat when I play enough, but my personal
        thinking is that your strats don't need to be 100% optimized and the
        "absolute best", what is more important is that everyone is on the same
        page in terms of what they are expected to do each round and what they
        expect their teammates to do. In other words, a poor plan is better than
        no plan at all. But I don't think my plan is poor anyway :D and I also
        think it's important to have one main person driving the framework so we
        can all work from a unified vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides Valorant, I played a lot of CS back in the day starting around
        2000, and played competitively for a bit as well, before e-sports was
        really a thing. So this framework is something I've put together based
        on all that experience as well as stuff I've just been thinking about
        over the years. Again, my framework may not be something that C9 or TSM
        or 100T or whoever can take and win a tournament with, but I hope it's
        good enough to keep most players diamond and below coordinated.
      </p>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        Besides the actual framework for how we approach each round, I think
        it's also important to have everyone on the same page with regards to
        how we discuss strategy, how and when we play, and basically everything
        outside of the actual game itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we grow and get more members, I'd like to split the team up by
        geography and rank, but for now at the beginning, we are focusing on
        Bronze/Silver/Gold players in US Central and US East. More on this in
        the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discord is our main place to organize and discuss any changes to the
        framework, which will be outlined on this site and open for anyone to
        make suggestions and changes to. The idea is that in your
        free-time/off-time/whenever we don't have 5 on, you can review the
        framework online and discuss it with others on discord to become very
        familiar with it. That way, when we DO have 5 people online, we can
        maximize our playing time and go immediately into games, since we should
        already be familiar with the concepts, and not have to waste time
        reviewing "strats" with someone new or something like that.
      </p>
      <h2>Framework Part 1 - Team Organization</h2>
      <p>
        Ok enough chat, I'm sure you're wondering what the actual framework is
        at this point. So let's get into it...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >The basis of the framework is to split the team up into groups of 2,
          2 and 1.</strong
        >
        Similar to basketball where you have 2 guards, 2 forwards, and a center.
        This works on both offense and defense and brings several advantages
        besides just in game tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
        First let's talk about why organizing the team this way is good from an
        outside of the game perspective. None of us are pros and we all play for
        fun, and everyone will have different schedules, and everyone will go
        through phases where they play a lot and then don't play much at all for
        a while. We want to ideally have groups of 10 or so people that we can
        draw from, and it really sucks practicing strats with 4 people and then
        having a 5th that's clueless. So by breaking the team up into roles, we
        create a "plug-n-play" system that's easy to rotate players in and out
        of, and have them instantly know how to work with the team because of
        the role and the framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another advantage is familiarity. By splitting into two groups of 2, you
        have a 'partner' you can work with essentially, and when we don't have 5
        on, you can just duo queue with your partner and still practice working
        together, become familiar with each other and know how they like to
        play, etc. and that will directly translate to our own 5 man games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, as the in game leader, it's easier to reason about 2 groups of 2
        rather than 4 individual players. In this system, the 1 person by
        themself is referred to as the 'lone wolf' and is always the one calling
        the plays and making the calls mid round, whether they are dead or
        alive. The other 2 groups of 2 can be assigned any animal name they
        choose, to make it very easy for the lone wolf to call out strats, not
        having to remember everyone's name. As a very simple example, the
        lonewolf might call out "me and the tigers are going to work mid, bears
        lurk outside of A and then we will execute together when I say go".
        Although you still can call more complicated strats, this gives us a
        nice baseline to work with.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also gives us a lot of flexibility with how to organize the team
        each round, i.e. you can have the 2 groups of 2 group up while the lone
        wolf lurks, to create a 4-1 type of split. Or the lone wolf can group
        with either team to create a 3/2, or go completely alone from them in a
        2-2-1 type of deal. There's lots of options and everyone should be able
        to easily reason about what their teammates are trying to do. It's also
        important to note that the groups of 2 don't always have to stick
        together. They might need to split up for map control, or maybe they are
        the ones watching the 2 flanks while the other 3 work mid, etc.
      </p>
      <h2>Framework Part 2 - Offense</h2>
      <p>
        I think approaching the game from the point of view of the offense and
        the offense's goals is the best way to think about the game, so we'll
        start with that and then talk about how a defense might counter some of
        these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        First off, we break up the round into 4 phases, to make it easier to
        communicate timing with each other. Rounds in Valorant are 100 seconds,
        or 1:40, which is hard to split up evenly. Additionally, a lot can
        happen in the first few seconds of a round, so we will define the 4
        phases of a round like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Phase 1 - First 10 seconds. Starts at 1:40, ends at 1:30</li>
        <li>Phase 2 - Next 30 seconds. 1:30 down to 1:00</li>
        <li>Phase 3 - Next 30 seconds. 1:00 down to 0:30</li>
        <li>Phase 4 - Final 30 seconds. 0:30 down to 0:00</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Two other quick notes before we jump into some of the specifics. 1)
        strats should always be relatively high level. I've never seen teams
        have success with trying to 'micro-manage' player movements, and it's
        too hard to get everyone on the same page when you have very specific
        strats about who needs to be where at what time. And everything can fall
        apart as soon as 1 person dies unexpectedly. So we will take a more
        flexible approach where the in-game leader can call out general
        movements and goals while still allowing players flexibility and
        creativity in their gameplay. 2) Try to think beyond just the individual
        round, and instead think about the match as a whole. Our goal on offense
        the first few rounds is to do a lot of fakes, hold the flanks to catch
        enemy flankers, and essentially feel out how they are playing, who is
        playing where, etc. The point of this is to
        <strong>condition the enemy team</strong>, to make them hesistant to
        flank us because they know we're watching it, and to make them hesistant
        to rotate because we might be faking. So this leads us directly into the
        next section.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first 6 rounds on offense, we will never execute on a site in phase
        1 or phase 2. This doesn't mean we don't show early aggression, in fact
        we will usually need to in order to draw them in to rotating. But we
        want to still play safe and not over-commit to a site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal in phase 1 and 2 is to make it seem like we're rushing A, B, or
        Mid, so one part of the team will be designated loud/stompy, while the
        other 2 or 3 guys will be stealth. During this time we want to play for
        map control, make sure they don't push for flanks, and listen for
        rotations. This works especially well in lower ranks as lots of players
        are very impatient and will rotate or flank very quickly. This is what
        we're trying to take advantage of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on how phase 1 and phase 2 play out, the in game leader will
        make a call about where to execute during phase 3 or 4 (Again this isn't
        a strict rule, just a general guideline). As much as possible, if we
        have enough players alive, we want this execute to come from 2 angles.
        Let's look at an example, using Split as a reference, although the
        concept can apply to any map.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wolf calls out that he and the Bears are going to be faking B, while the
        Lions hold the bomb and play hidden A. In phase 1, the 3 players at B
        throw some util, spam some angles, and in general make noise and make it
        seem like we're trying to play to take B. Often times this alone is
        enough to get at least 1, if not both, defenders from A to start
        rotating to B, especially if there is an early pick. One might even try
        to flank, which the Lions should easily be able to stop. But for this
        example, let's say we get an early trade at B and it's now 4v4, and the
        A players heard one player rotating off of A ramps. As soon as we get
        the trade, the B players should immediately fall back, while the A
        players will try to quietly move in and take a little map control on
        their side, while waiting for the 2 players from B to rotate over to A
        and execute together. It's preferable for the rotators to go through mid
        and ropes to A, so we can be attacking A from 2 angles, but of course
        this is riskier than doing the long rotate through spawn or sewers.
      </p>
      <p>
        So it's just a basic fake, but you can see how we talk about it within
        the confines of our framework. That's the important part. And you can do
        a LOT of variations on a simple fake like that. Remember our high level
        goal is to keep the defense honest, to keep them on their toes so they
        never known when our attack is a real one or a fake. I think a lot of
        people's instinct once their team gets an early pick is to push where
        that player was playing. It makes sense to an extent, we've created a
        hole in the defense and we want to push in and take that map control.
        However, most teams will immediately rotate to that and you might be
        pushing into 3 guys all waiting for you, since they know you're trying
        to push off of that pick. Instead, I think it's better to
        <strong>immediately fall back</strong> after a first pick. The reasoning
        is, we now have a 5v4 situation, and if we fall back, the enemy team
        will now be unsure of which site we are going towards. The defenders
        will be forced to play 2 people on each site, or gamble with a 3/1
        setup. This should theoretically give us a huge advantage, we can
        regroup and hit EITHER A or B, and it should hopefully be a 5v2
        situation.
      </p>
      <h2>Framework Part 3 - Defense</h2>
      <p>Work in progress.</p>
      <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>
        So that's the high level overview of how we organize the team in game,
        but there is a lot more to the framework than just that. This section is
        a work in progress while I just jot out random thoughts right now. For
        example, how does it address some of those pet peeves from above?
      </p>

        <li>
          4+ duelist comps - Each group of 2 can not have more than 1 duelist.
          That means, AT MAXIMUM our team will have 3 duelists, and only if the
          lone wolf chooses a duelist. More often we will probably prefer 2
          duelist comps, with a duelist in each group of 2.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>TBD:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
